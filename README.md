## About

* This page displays several buttons, which are named different feelings/emotions. When the user clicks on a button, 10 still images, which are retrieved from the GIPHY API, appear on the page. The user may click on the images to turn them into gifs. By clicking the images again, the user may return the gifs to still images. The user may also create more feeling/emotion buttons by typing them in the input field and pressing the submit button. The added buttons also display still images and gifs.
